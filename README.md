# anarion's zmk config

This is my personal ZMK firmware configuration. It consists of a 42-keys base layout that I use with my [Porcupine keyboard](https://github.com/anarion80/porcupine).

It is using excellent [zmk-config](https://github.com/urob/zmk-config) from [urob](https://github.com/urob) with only small modifications.

I switched from QMK, where even with also excellent [Bi-lateral combinations](https://sunaku.github.io/home-row-mods.html) and [multi-mod crossover chords](https://github.com/manna-harbour/qmk_firmware/pull/56) by [sunaku](https://sunaku.github.io) I could not type fast enough with Home Row Mods without accidently triggering them. With urob's pack of PRs - no issue!
